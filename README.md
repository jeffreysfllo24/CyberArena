# Cyber Arena
Cyber Arena is a two player card game all about staying safe online! Have fun while learning about the cybersecurity risks to your everyday devices and how to protect yourself. Earn points by playing asset cards but be aware of enemy cyber attacks! To protect your assets utilize defence cards strategically!

# How to Play?

Playing Cyber Arena with your friends is simple! 

1. Download the latest Cyber Arena build (Mac or Windows) from the [release page](https://github.com/jeffreysfllo24/SecureWorksHackathon2022/releases/tag/v1.0).
2. Choose one player to host the game and share the generated IP and port number with your friend (This is not your computer's IP, but an IP assigned by our relay server). The client will input the IP and port number and connect.
3. That's it :smile: 

**Mac**

If you are using a Mac and it is set to allows apps from only the App Store and identified developers you may need to go to **System Preferences -> Security and Privacy to allow for the app to be opened**.

**Windows**

On Windows you may get a popup that says your firewall blocked Cyber Arena. You can allow Cyber Arena to communicate over private networks.

# Inspiration
Cybersecurity is becoming ever more important in the digital world and so too is educating ourselves on how to protect against cyberattacks. Training courses on cybersecurity have always struggled with being both educational and fun. However, that doesnâ€™t mean learning about security has to be a grind. We challenged ourselves to create a game for friends/family of all ages that teaches information security in an engaging and fun way. Combining our love for card games and security, we built Cyber Arena! 

# Gameplay

**Cyber Arena** is easy to play and loads of fun! The goal is to accumulate the most points at the end of 10 turns. At the heart of the game are the cards which are split up into assets, defenses and attacks.

## Asset Cards
Points are earned by playing asset cards. At the end of each turn you gain points based on how many asset cards are present on your side of the board (i.e if you have 3 asset cards on the field you gain 3 points after you end your turn). Asset cards cards can be played on any of the 6 empty sectors of a players board. 

## Defense Cards
Players can protect their assets using "defense" cards. At most one defense card can be played on a sector containing an asset card. 

## Attack Cards
You want to keep your asset cards safe from attacks! Attack cards can be used to remove a defense card or asset card if no defense is present from an enemy sector. 

## Categories
Every card belongs to a category of security for learning purposes! Gain a better understanding of which attacks are a threat to what assets, and what defenses can protect the asset.
