# How to Play?

Playing Cyber Arena with your friends is simple! 

1. Download the latest Cyber Arena build from the releases.
2. Choose one player to host the game and share the generated IP and port number with your friend. (This is not your computer's IP, but an IP assigned by our relay server.)
3. That's it :smile:
